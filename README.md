# Is this a school project? NAH as always, i was just bored.
I ran those 2 scripts with these components: 
- Arduino UNO R3
  - BREADBOARD
  - 0.96 INCH MONITOR
  - NRF24L01
- Arduino UNO R4 WIFI
  - NRF24L01


### What these 2 codes do ? 
The "transimitter.ino" is meant to be uploaded to the R4 because it is the one 
which will only send messages AFTER performing a HANDSHAKE-LIKE protocol.

The "receveir.ino" initially sends it's public key to whoever is on the same frequency, 
once it finds someone it starts printing out the message that it receives on the 0.96 inch screen.


###HOW DO I CONNECT THOSE ? 
I'm trying to install fritzing without paying when i get it i will upload the scheme XD
